    "\n",
    "A subquery is a SQL statement that has another SQL query embedded in the clause. They may occur in:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A SELECT clause\n",
    "- A FROM clause\n",
    "- A WHERE clause\n",
    "\n",
    "The subquery can be nested inside a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement or inside another subquery. A subquery is usually added within the WHERE Clause of another SQL SELECT statement.\n",

    "A general subquery from the Employees table can look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/subquery.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the comparison operators, such as >, <, or =. The comparison operator can also be a multiple-row operator, such as IN, ANY, or ALL. In this case, we are trying to narrow down the comparison in a subquery before applying it to the overall table.\n",
    "\n",
    "A subquery is also called an inner query or inner select, while the statement containing a subquery is also called an outer query or outer select. The inner query executes first before its parent query so that the results of an inner query can be passed to the outer query.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use a subquery in a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `DELETE`, or `UPDATE` statement to perform the following tasks:\n",
    "- Compare an expression to the result of the query\n",
    "- Determine if an expression is included in the results of the query\n",
    "- Check whether the query selects any rows\n",
